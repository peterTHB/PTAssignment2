This program is designed to introduce users to a simplified version of a booking system.
Users familiar with using a Uber driving application or similar program should be familiar
with how this program operates, albeit on the an easier level.

Usage
======
Users may choose to create a new car in order to stimulate the process of booking a car for 
traveling purposes. In addition, users may choose to create a fancier, silver service car 
to stimulate the experience of riding a much more fancier vehicle for transportation. 

System Requirements
======
 - Users can use this program on all kinds of platforms that support the usage of the Java language.
 - No current bug crashes are reported at the time of writing this.
 
 
Files
======
Program should include the following directories and files
- app: Menu.java, MiRideApplication.java
- cars: Booking.java, Car.java, SilverServiceCar.java
- exceptions: CorruptedFiles.java, InvalidBooking.java, InvalidDate.java, InvalidId.java, InvalidRefreshments.java, NullFile.java
- main: Driver.java
- messages: ErrorMessages.java
- persistence: MainPersistence.java
- utilities: DateTime.java, DateUtilities.java, MiRidesUtilities.java
As well as additional libraries provided with the Java language.
